## What is public key cryptography?[](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/B8rpM8E16LQ#What-is-public-key-cryptography?)

Public key cryptography is a cryptographic system used for the encryption/decryption of data. It is not one way like a hash function, meaning that the data, once encrypted, can be decrypted if you have the required key.

You start by generating a special, related pair of keys. These keys can be generated in a pair only. They are output from single execution of a key generation algorithm.

-   Golden key: private key
-   Silver key : public key

## Key usage[](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/B8rpM8E16LQ#Key-usage)

Any key can lock or encrypt the data. To unlock or decrypt we need the other key. The only way to decrypt and make the data readable is by having the corresponding key.

In the next lesson, we will show how this cryptographic technique is used to ensure communication security.
