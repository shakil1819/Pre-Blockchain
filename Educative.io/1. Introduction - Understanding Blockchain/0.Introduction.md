# Introduction

Welcome to the course! To fully understand and appreciate blockchain, there are multiple interdependent topics you need to understand together. Some foundations need to be built so the terminology can make sense. This course will slowly build those foundations. By the end of this course, you will be able to understand and run a hyperledger fabric network, deploy your chaincode and interact with it.

Letâ€™s begin with a basic introduction to blockchain. There are some gaps in this introduction that will be filled sometime in the next 2-3 chapters so please give it some time and things will start to come together.

Its really by the end of the 4th chapter when you will be able to understand blockchain and its potential to revolutionize the world.

In the next lesson, we will discuss some distinctive features of blockchain.
