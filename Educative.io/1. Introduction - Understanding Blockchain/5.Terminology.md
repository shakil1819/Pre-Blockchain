# Terminology

In this lesson, we will explain the different terminologies used so far in this chapter

Since there are multiple terms being used here lets clarify some so there is no confusion:

*The data store* that keeps all blockchain data is called a **ledger**. Each entry in the ledger is called a **transaction**. The transactions are timestamped and stored in groups of **blocks**.

On the ledger you can only add a new transaction or read the old ones. You can not update or delete anything.

The **ledger** is designed to be immutable using *cryptographic algorithms* (we will study in next chapter) and its distributed design. The **ledger** is replicated and maintained by multiple **hosts** or **peers** or **nodes**. This is why its called **DLT** or **Distributed Ledger Technology**.

In the next lesson, we will see a quick recap of the whole chapter.
