-   [Why?](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/YQlK1mDPgpK#Why?)
-   [Next: How?](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/YQlK1mDPgpK#Next:-How?)

To recap: we saw in this chapter the _what_ and _why_ of blockchain.

## What?[](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/YQlK1mDPgpK#What?)

Blockchain or Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a ‘trustable data record’ built as a distributed system.

## Why?[](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/YQlK1mDPgpK#Why?)

Current system of records either lack trust or pay a cost for trust. There is a huge opportunity to solve these issues in current systems of records.

## Next: How?[](https://www.educative.io/courses/hands-on-blockchain-hyperledger-fabric/YQlK1mDPgpK#Next:-How?)

In the next 2 chapters we will see from a tech perspective, how blockchain achieves this quality of ‘immutability and trust’.

In the next chapter, we will explain the different pre-requisites for understanding blockchain.
