# Consensus Protocol
-   A secure chain is a single main chain with a consistent state, and each valid block added to the chain increases the trust level of the chain.
    
-   Miners compete to add their block to the chain, but when multiple miners want to add their candidate block, a method or protocol is needed to choose the next block. This is where Proof of Work comes in.
    
-   Proof of Work is a consensus protocol that uses hashing. Miners compute the hash of the block header elements with a variable nonce value. If the hash value is less than a certain threshold, the puzzle has been solved, and the miner broadcasts the winning block.
    
-   Non-winning miner nodes add the new block to their local copy of the chain and move on to working on the next block.
    
-   The winner of the Proof of Work process receives an incentive for creating the block.
    
-   Proof of Work is used by bitcoin and the current version of Ethereum, but many other approaches such as Proof of Stake and Proof of Elapsed Time have been proposed and are hotly debated among blockchain developers.
