# Practitioner's Perspective: Decentralized Governance

![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 4/1.Consensus Protocol/attachments/index.mp4]]
Here are the main points:

-   Building a system as important as blockchain requires the involvement of diverse groups of people, not just a small group of individuals.
-   The Internet was ideal for broadcasting information but did not solve the problem of transactions without centralized authorities.
-   The democratization of transactions and spreading it globally is powerful, but it also requires the involvement of a diverse group of people.
-   It is important that blockchain technologies are built in an openly governed, open-source, and meritocratic manner.
-   The protocols for Ethereum, Hyperledger, and other blockchain technologies are being built by hundreds of people all over the world, and this is how it should be.
-   Blockchain is a young technology, and no one can claim to be a master of it yet.
-   Anyone can get involved in blockchain and become an expert, regardless of their background or identity.
