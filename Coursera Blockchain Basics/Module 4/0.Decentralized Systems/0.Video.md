# Trust Essentials: Decentralized Systems

![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 4/0.Decentralized Systems/attachments/index.mp4]]

-   Public key cryptography and hashing are used for validation in blockchain.
-   The module will cover trust, security, validation, verification, and consensus in blockchain.
-   Trust in a centralized system is established through pre-established security measures and validation at various checkpoints.
-   In a decentralized system, trust is established through specific protocols for securing, validating, verifying, and executing transactions.
-   The Trust Trail consists of various steps including validating transactions, verifying gas and resources, executing transactions, forming blocks, working towards consensus, finalizing blocks, and confirming transactions.
-   In Bitcoin and Ethereum, about 20 criteria are checked before validating a transaction, including syntax, transaction signature, timestamp, nonce, gas limit, and sender account balance.
-   Execution of transactions involves computing the Merkle tree hash of validated transactions, executing smart contracts, and computing the state root and receipt root of the block header.
-   The next lesson will cover the consensus process in the Trust Trail.
