# Robustness

-   Trust in a decentralized blockchain involves managing exceptions satisfactorily.
-   ==Robustness is the ability to manage exceptional situations.==
-   Double spending is an exception that can occur during the blockchain process, where more than one transaction references the same digital asset.
-   In the case of a chain split, the bitcoin protocol allows for two chains to exist for the next cycle. The winner of the next cycle for block creation consolidates one of the chains, which becomes the accepted chain.
-   Ethereum handles double spending by allowing runner-up blocks and allocating a small incentive for them. New blocks are added only to the main chain and not to the runner-up chains.
-   A policy for handling double spending in Bitcoin is to allow the first transaction that references the digital asset and reject the rest of the transactions that reference the same digital asset.
-   In Ethereum, a combination of account number and global nonce is used to address the double spending issue.
-   Well-defined processes for handling exceptions improve trust in the blockchain.
