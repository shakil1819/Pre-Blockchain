# Forks

![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 4/3.Forks/attachments/index.mp4]]
Here's a summary of the key points:

-   Forks are a normal process in the evolution of blockchain technology, and hard and soft forks are common terms used in the context of blockchain.
-   ==Soft forks are minor changes that are made to the blockchain's software to address an issue, while hard forks are major changes that result in the emergence of two incompatible chains.==
-   ==Hard forks require a planned process for change, while soft forks can be handled as a naturally expected occurrence within the blockchain.==
-   Hard forks can be used to improve the blockchain framework, and well-managed forks help build credibility in the blockchain by providing approaches to manage unexpected faults and planned improvements.
-   The Ethereum hard fork that happened on October 17, 2017, was a planned fork with specific Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), such as parallel processing of transactions and reduced minor incentive.
-   Managing forks is important for maintaining the robustness and trust in the blockchain, and well-managed forks can help build credibility in the blockchain by providing approaches to manage unexpected faults and planned improvements.
