# Ethereum Blockchain: Smart Contracts

![[index_5.mp4]]

-   Bitcoin blockchain was intended for peer-to-peer transfer of value, while Ethereum blockchain introduced smart contracts in 2013.
-   Ethereum supports smart contracts and a virtual machine on which smart contracts execute, enabling decentralized applications (dApps) that can do more than just transfer value.
-   Smart contracts are pieces of code deployed on blockchain nodes and are initiated by messages embedded in transactions.
-   Ethereum enables transactions with sophisticated operations, such as conditional transfers, evaluations, multiple signatures, or time-based actions.
-   Smart contracts are written in programming languages like Solidity and resemble class definitions in object-oriented design.
-   Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides a computational infrastructure to execute smart contract code on every node in the Ethereum network, regardless of hardware or operating system.
-   Smart contracts add a layer of logic and computation to the trust infrastructure of the blockchain, enhancing the basic value transfer capability of the Bitcoin blockchain.
-   Smart contracts are compiled into byte code and executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
