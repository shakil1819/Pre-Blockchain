# Ethereum Operations
![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 2/2.Ethereum Operations/attachments/index.mp4]]

Summary:

-   Ether transfers involve specifying the amount, target address, and gas fees.
-   Gas fees are paid to miners for adding the transaction block to the blockchain.
-   Ethereum nodes host software for transaction initiation, validation, mining, block creation, and smart contract execution.
-   Smart contracts are designed, developed, compiled, and deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
-   When a transaction targets a smart contract, the execution code is activated and executed on the EVM.
-   The current state of the smart contract is the values of its variables, which may be updated during execution.
-   Results of smart contract execution are reflected in receipts and maintained in the blockchain.
-   Transactions are validated for timestamp, nonce, and sufficient fees before being executed by miner nodes.
-   Miner nodes execute in-work smart contract code and participate in consensus using a memory-based proof-of-work protocol.
-   The next lesson will explore the incentive model for paying for these operations.
