# Ethereum Structure

-   Bitcoin uses unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to define the state, while Ethereum introduces the concept of an account as part of the protocol.
-   Ethereum has two types of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) and Contract Accounts (CA).
-   EOAs are controlled by private keys and are needed to participate in the Ethereum network.
-   Contract Accounts represent smart contracts and are controlled by code, activated only by an EOA.
-   Transactions in Ethereum update account balances directly, unlike Bitcoin's UTXOs.
-   Transactions in Ethereum can transfer value and messages/data between accounts, resulting in state transitions.
-   Transactions in Ethereum require fees, which are paid in Wei (a lower denomination of Ether).
-   Ethereum transactions include recipient, digital signature, amount of Wei to transfer, optional data field, STARTGAS (maximum computational steps), and gas price (fee for computations).
-   Ethereum blocks have a header, transactions, and runner-up block headers.
-   Block details in Ethereum include height, timestamp, block hash, previous hash, difficulty, total difficulty, size, gas used, gas limit, nonce, and block reward.
-   Accounts are the basic units of the Ethereum protocol and include EOAs and Smart Contract Accounts.
-   Ethereum transactions include fields for both Ether transfers and messages for invoking smart contracts.
-   Ethereum blocks contain details about gas/fee limits, the state of smart contracts, and runner-up headers.
