# Incentive Model

![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 2/3.Incentive Model/attachments/index_2.mp4]]

Summary:

-   Ethereum uses an incentive-based model for block creation, where miners are incentivized with base fees of three Ethers and transaction fees.
-   Gas points are used to specify fees for computations in Ethereum, and gas points allow for cryptocurrency-independent valuation of transaction fees.
-   Gas limit is the amount of gas points available for a block to spend, and gas spent is the actual amount of gas used in block creation.
-   Miners who create new blocks are rewarded with base fees and transaction fees, as well as gas points for execution of smart contract transactions.
-   Other miners who solve the proof-of-work puzzle but do not win the block are called Ommers, and they receive a small percentage of total gas points as consolation and for network security.
-   Transactions in Ethereum, including Ether transfers, require fees or gas points, and miners are paid fees for security, validation, execution of smart contracts, and block creation.
-   Ethereum will be used as a reference blockchain in the next two modules and following two courses.
