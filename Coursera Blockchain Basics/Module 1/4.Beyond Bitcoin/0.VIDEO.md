# Beyond Bitcoin

![[index_4.mp4]]

Important points from the given text:

1.  Bitcoin blockchain is open-source and the entire code is available on GitHub.
2.  Bitcoin's open-source code was extended to release different cryptocurrencies, resulting in the introduction of over 300 cryptocurrencies.
3.  Bitcoin supports a feature called scripts for conditional transfer of values, while Ethereum extended this feature into a full-blown code execution framework called smart contracts.
4.  Three major types of blockchains emerged from the Bitcoin foundation: Type one deals with coins in a cryptocurrency currency chain (e.g., Bitcoin), type two supports cryptocurrency and a business logic layer (e.g., Ethereum), and type three involves no currency but supports software execution for business logic (e.g., The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger).
5.  With the addition of code execution, the concept of public access to the blockchain becomes important, leading to the classification of blockchains into public, private, and permissioned based on access limits.
6.  Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain, where anyone can join and leave as they wish, transaction blocks and the blockchain are publicly observable, and participants are anonymous.
7.  Private blockchains limit access to selected participants, such as those within an organization, for simplifying operations.
8.  Permissioned blockchains, also called consortium blockchains, are meant for a consortium of collaborating parties and provide ease of governance, provenance, and accountability.
9.  Permissioned blockchains allow only users with permission to collaborate and transact, combining benefits of both public and private blockchains.
10.  Smart contracts have opened up broader applications for blockchain technology, and private and permissioned blockchains allow for controlled access to the blockchain, enabling diverse business models.

Note: The given text provides information on different types of blockchains, including their features and classifications based on access limits. It highlights the open-source nature of Bitcoin, the introduction of different cryptocurrencies from Bitcoin's code, and the significance of smart contracts in expanding the applications of blockchain technology. It also explains the concepts of public, private, and permissioned blockchains, and their respective characteristics.
