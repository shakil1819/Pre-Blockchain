Important points to note from the given text:

1.  Operations in a decentralized blockchain network are the responsibility of peer participants and their respective computational nodes, such as laptops, desktops, and server racks.
2.  Participants in a blockchain network include those who initiate transactions (transfers of value) and miners who verify transactions, compete to create a block, and reach consensus on the next block creation.
3.  Miners are incentivized with bitcoins for their efforts in managing the blockchain.
4.  Transaction validation is carried out independently by all miners and involves validating more than 20 criteria, including size, syntax, and UTXO references.
5.  Valid transactions are added to a pool of transactions, from which miners select a set of transactions to create a block.
6.  Miners compete to solve a computational puzzle to earn the right to create the next block, which is broadcast to the network once solved.
7.  Other participants verify the new block, and consensus is reached to add it to the chain.
8.  The consensus algorithm used in the Bitcoin blockchain is called proof-of-work, which involves computational power to solve the puzzle and claim the right to create the next block.
9.  The first transaction in a confirmed block, known as the coinbase transaction, generates miner's fees for the block creation and is how new coins are minted in Bitcoin.
10.  The main operations in a blockchain are transaction validation and block creation with the consensus of the participants, and there are underlying implicit operations as well in the Bitcoin blockchain.
