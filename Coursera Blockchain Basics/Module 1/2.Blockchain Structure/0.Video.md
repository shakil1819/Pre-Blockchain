# Blockchain Structure

![[index_2.mp4]]

Important points and notes from the given text:

-   Transactions are the basic element of the Bitcoin blockchain.
-   Transactions are validated and broadcasted, and many transactions form a block.
-   Blocks are linked together through a digital data link to form a chain, and blocks go through a consensus process to select the next block to be added to the chain.
-   Miners, which are special peer nodes, validate and participate in the consensus process using powerful computers and software defined by the blockchain protocol.
-   <mark class="hltr-green">Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)</mark> collectively <mark class="hltr-green">define the state of the Bitcoin blockchain, and UTXOs are referenced as inputs and outputs in transactions.</mark>
-   UTXOs are stored by participant nodes in a database, and they are used to transmit value from one UTXO to newly created output UTXOs according to the sender's request.
-   UTXOs have a unique identifier, an index, a value, and an optional script that defines the condition under which the output can be spent.
-   Participants can validate transaction contents, including checking if the referenced input UTXOs exist in the network state.
-   Blocks are composed of a header of information and a set of valid transactions.
-   The genesis block, which initiated the Bitcoin blockchain, had one transaction of 50 Bitcoins and created a UTXO output.
-   Blocks are linked together using the hash of the previous block, forming the chain of blocks, known as the blockchain.

Note: The text provides an overview of the basic structure of the Bitcoin blockchain, including transactions, UTXOs, and blocks, as well as the role of miners and the process of consensus. It also mentions the concept of the genesis block and how blocks are linked together to form the blockchain.
