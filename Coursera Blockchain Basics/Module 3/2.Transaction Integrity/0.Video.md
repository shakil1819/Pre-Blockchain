# Transaction Integrity

1.  To ensure the integrity of a transaction in a decentralized network, three key requirements are identified: a unique account address, authorization through digital signing, and verification of content integrity.
2.  Account addresses are generated using a public key/private key pair. A random 256-bit number serves as the private key, and an ECC algorithm is applied to obtain a unique public key. A hashing function is then used to obtain the account address, which is shorter in size (20 bytes or 160 bits).
3.  Digital signing is used for transaction authorization and non-repudiation. Data fields of the transaction are hashed and encrypted using the private key, resulting in a digital signature. The receiver can verify the integrity of the transaction by recomputing the hash using the public key and comparing it with the received hash.
4.  Complete transaction verification includes checking the timestamp, nonce, account balances, and sufficiency of fees.
5.  The use of hashing and public key cryptography helps to solve the problems of unique identification, authorization, and verification in decentralized networks like blockchains.
