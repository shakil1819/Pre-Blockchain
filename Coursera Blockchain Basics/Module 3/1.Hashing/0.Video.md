# Hashing

-   Learning about encryption hashing is important for understanding the security of blockchain transactions and protecting private keys.
-   Hashing is a process that transforms input data into a unique fixed-length value, and it plays a critical role in the integrity of transactions and confidentiality of data in blockchain.
-   Hash functions should be one-way and collision-free, meaning it should be impossible to derive the original data from the hash value and two different datasets should have an extremely low probability of producing the same hash value.
-   Common hash sizes in blockchain are 256 bits, and commonly used hash functions are SHA-3, SHA-256, and Keccak.
-   Tree-structured hash is used when the number of items to be hashed differ from block to block, while a simple hash is used when there is a fixed number of items to be hashed.
-   Tree structure helps with efficiency of repeated operations, such as transaction modification and state changes in blockchain.
-   Hashing functions are used in various aspects of blockchain, such as generating account addresses, digital signatures, transaction hash, state hash, receipt hash, and block header hash.
-   SHA-3, SHA-256, and Keccak-256 are commonly used algorithms for hash generation in blockchains.
