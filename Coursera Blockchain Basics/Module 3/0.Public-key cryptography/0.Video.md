# Algorithms & Techniques: Public-Key Cryptography
![[Coursera Blockchain Basics/Module 3/0.Public-key cryptography/attachments/index_3.mp4]]
Summary points:

-   Two techniques, hashing and asymmetric key encryption, are used for securing the blockchain and ensuring efficient validation and verification.
-   Hashing and asymmetric key encryption depend on complex proven algorithms, and they play critical roles in securing the decentralized chain.
-   Public-key cryptography is used to identify, authorize, and authenticate participants in a blockchain network, as conventional means of credentials verification may not be applicable.
-   Symmetric key encryption, where the same key is used for encryption and decryption, has issues such as easy key derivation and key distribution challenges.
-   Public-key cryptography employs two different keys, a public key and a private key, to address the issues of symmetric key encryption.
-   Public-key encryption allows for data to be encrypted with one key and decrypted with the corresponding key, ensuring authentication of sender and receiver.
-   A popular implementation of public-key cryptography is the RSA algorithm, but more efficient and stronger algorithms such as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are used in blockchain protocols.
-   ECC is used in Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains for generating key pairs, as it is stronger than RSA for a given number of bits, with 256-bit ECC key pair being equivalent in strength to about 3072 bits of RSA key pair.
